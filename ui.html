	<h1>User Interfaces</h1>

	<h2>Papi RedSox Game Time Companion UI</h2>

	<h2>EHANG 184 AAV UI</h2>
		<p><a href="ehang.pdf">Click here</a> to see the final personal deliverable for my user interface design course.<br>I have included the screens below.</p>

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Welcome screen.</b><br>The user is welcomed by name, and her destination is identified by its name, which in this case is its relation to her. The user has the option to edit the flight path, change the destination, or start the safety briefing.</p>
		<object data="ehang/1-welcome.png"></object>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Edit the flight path.</b><br> The user moves the pencil to draw a preferred path, and the system checks the path to make sure it is safe. The user will then have the option to control the rate of the flight and other details (e.g., hover while flying over the water), which will also be confirmed by the system. These changes to the original flight path will come at an additional cost, which will vary based on the changes.</p>
		<object data="ehang/2-path.png"></object>
	</div>

	<div class="box">	
		<p><b>Flight screen (post safety briefing).</b><br> The user can view the flight’s progress on its route along with various flight parameters. The user can also click on any points of interest to learn more about them. These landmarks can be saved for future trips.</p>
		<object data="ehang/3-flight.png"></object>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Camera screen.</b><br> The user can view the surroundings from multiple cameras, including one within the vehicle for selfies. The user also has the option to take snapshots or videos of these views, which can be purchased through the shop.</p>
		<object data="ehang/4-camera.png"></object>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Entertainment screen.</b><br> The user can watch shows, listen to music, play games, etc. The user can connect a personal phone to the system to use personal applications that are not offered by the interface. The user can also control the order of the available options by different settings, such as by recommendation, popularity, frequency of use, etc.</p>
		<object data="ehang/5-entertainment.png"></object>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Entertainment screen when the user is watching a show.</b><br>Using slide navigation, or the clickable arrow on the right side of the screen, the user can control relevant settings such as volume and screen brightness. The user can pause the video by double tapping the screen and resume it in the same way. Unlike with music, the show will automatically pause if the user switches screens.</p>
		<object data="ehang/6-entertainment-settings.png"></object>
	</div>
		

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Shop screen.</b><br> The user can purchase photos or videos from the trip or buy EHANG 184 merchandise such as cups, stickers, shirts, and sweatshirts. If the user consents, the interface will remember the user’s credit card information to streamline future purchases.</p>
		<object data="ehang/7-store.png"></object>
	</div>
		

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Settings screen.</b><br> Allows the user to adjust the volume of the music, the brightness of the screen, and climate controls.</p>
		<object data="ehang/8-settings.png"></object>
	</div>
	

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Help screen.</b><br> The options vary by color to reflect the immediacy of the help required.</p>
		<object data="ehang/9-help.png"></object>
	</div>
		

	<div class="box">
		<p><b>Final screen of the interface.</b><br> Thanks the user for flying with the ePilot and allows the user to revisit the shop for a souvenir from the trip.</p>
		<object data="ehang/10-thanks.png"></object>
	</div>
