	<p>After watching a few episodes of the show "Tiny Luxury" on HGTV, I realized how cool I think tiny houses are!
	<br>I found a course called "Designing a Tiny House with SketchUp" on Lynda, and I made it one of my summer goals to complete. 
	<br>This is an animation of the result.</p>

	<p>Note: I've called it "my" tiny house because I've built this model, but this is not my current nor prospective house. That's still in the works.</p>
